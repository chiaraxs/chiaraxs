<p align="center">### Hi honeys! 👋🏻 </p>
My name is <em><strong>Chiara</em></strong>, a girl passionate about technology, and a full stack web developer based in Italy. 🙃 

- 💕 I felt in love with programming very quicly, since 2010 but I started to really learn in 2021: my first love was Vue.js. Then, it was PHP's and Laravel's turn. I cant' live without them!
- ⚡ Fun (but sad) fact: code bugs make me both mad and excited. 
- ✨ I love the dark side of backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently especially working with PHP and Laravel on some really interesting projects.
