### Hi there! 👋🏻 
I'm <em><strong>Chiara</em></strong>, a junior full stack web developer based in Italy. 🙃 

- 💕 My first love was Vue.js. Then, very quickly (I'm a bad lover!), I fell in love with Php and Laravel and now it's my only brain addiction.
- ⚡ Fun (but sad) fact: code bugs make me both mad and excited. 
- ✨ I love the dark side of backend development.
